\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The open source program \selen solves numerically the so--called ``Sea Level Equation'' (SLE) for a spherical, layered, non--rotating Earth with Maxwell viscoelastic rheology. 

The SLE  is an integral equation that was introduced in the $70$s to model the \sealevel variations in response to the melting of late--Pleistocene ice--sheets, but it can also be employed for predictions of geodetic quantities in response to present-day melting of continental ice-sheets. \selen can compute vertical and horizontal surface displacements, gravity variations and \sealevel changes on a global and regional scale. 

\selen (acronym of SEa Level EquatioN solver) is particularly oriented to scientists at their first approach to the glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) problem and, according to our experience, it can be successfully used in teaching. The current release (2.9) considerably improves the previous version of the code in terms of computational efficiency, portability and versatility. As far as we know, 
\selen is the only open source program designed for solving the SLE. 

\selen 2.9 solves the SLE following the classical theory of \citet{Farrell_and_Clark_1976}. In the future release of \selen (\selen 3.0), which is under development, two important new features will be introduced: the rotational feedback on \sealevel and the horizontal migration of shorelines in response to \sealevel change. 

This User guide describes the essentials of the theory behind the SLE, and provides instructions for the configuration and execution of \selens.

\section{Theoretical background}\label{sec:theory}

Here we briefly illustrate the background theory of the SLE, the integral equation that describes the \sealevel variations and solid Earth deformations associated with GIA. Essentially, the material that follows is a condensed summary of the SLE theory first exposed by \citet{Farrell_and_Clark_1976}. 

For further details, including the spatiotemporal discretization of the SLE and its  numerical implementation, the reader is referred to the review of \citet{Spada_and_Stocchi_2006} and to references therein. 

\subsection{Sea Level and Sea Level change}\label{sec:slc}

Introducing the SLE requires some basic definition involving the general concept of ``\sealevels''. 
\emph{Absolute \sealevels} is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sl-def}
\textrm{SL}(\omega,t) = R_{ss}(\omega,t) - R_{se}(\omega,t), 
\end{equation}
where $\omega\equiv (\theta,\lambda)$, $\theta$ is colatitude and $\lambda$ is longitude, $t$ is time, and
$R_{ss}$ and $R_{se}$ denote the radii of the (equipotential) sea surface and of the solid surface 
of the Earth, both relative to the Earth's center of mass (CM). 

The quantity involved in the SLE is \emph{sea level change}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:s-definition}
S(\omega, t) = \textrm{SL}(\omega,t) - \textrm{SL}(\omega,t_{r}), 
\end{equation}
where $t_{r} \le t$ denotes a remote time. For studies 
of past \sealevel variations, it is convenient to introduce 
\emph{relative sea level} (RSL):
\begin{equation}
\textrm{RSL}(\omega,t_{BP})=\textrm{SL}(\omega,t_{BP})- \textrm{SL}(\omega,t_{p}),
\end{equation}
where $t=t_{BP}$ is a given time before present (BP) and $t=t_p$ is present time. 
Using (\ref{eq:s-definition}), {RSL} is easily expressed in terms of \sealevel change: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rsl-vs-s}
\textrm{RSL}(\omega,t_{BP})= {S}(\omega,t_{BP})- {S}(\omega,t_{p}).
\end{equation}

An expression for $S(\omega, t)$ which is suitable in GIA studies is 
obtained using (\ref{eq:sl-def}) in
(\ref{eq:s-definition}): 
\begin{equation}\label{sle-original}
S(\omega, t) = N(\omega,t) - U(\omega,t), 
\end{equation}
where $N(\omega,t)= R_{ss}(\omega,t) - R_{ss}(\omega,t_r)$ is the \textit{sea surface variation} relative to the CM (sometimes referred to as \emph{absolute \sealevel change}) and $U(\omega,t)= R_{se}(\omega,t) - R_{se}(\omega,t_r)$ is the \emph{vertical displacement} of the solid surface of the Earth. Note that $S(\omega, t)$ is defined over the whole Earth surface, including the continental masses. 

Eq.~(\ref{sle-original}) represents the SLE in its simplest form; 
what follows is aimed to illustrate the relationship between $S$ and the variations of the ice thickness through time, in order to obtain a form of the SLE amenable to a numerical approach. 

\subsection{The Sea Level Equation}\label{sec:sle}

According to \citet{Farrell_and_Clark_1976}, the sea surface variation $N$ in Eq.~(\ref{sle-original}) can be written as 
\begin{equation}\label{n_sle}
{N}(\omega, t) = G(\omega, t) + c(t),  
\end{equation}
where $c$ is yet undetermined and the \emph{geoid height variation} is 
\begin{equation}\label{g_sle}
G(\omega, t) = \frac{\Phi}{\gamma}(\omega, t),  
\end{equation}
in which $\gamma$ is the reference gravity at the surface of the Earth and $\Phi(\omega,t)$ is the 
\emph{total
variation of the gravity potential}. 

Hence, using Eq.~(\ref{n_sle}) into (\ref{sle-original}) gives 
\begin{equation}\label{sle-c}
S(\omega, t) = \frac{\Phi}{\gamma} - U +c, 
\end{equation}
where we have dropped the ($\omega,t$) dependence in right hand side to simplify notation. Mass
conservation of the system (Ice sheets + Oceans) is ensured taking   
\begin{equation}\label{c-constant}
c(t) = - \frac{m_i}{\rho_{w}A_{o}} - \overline{ \biggl( \frac{\Phi}{\gamma} - U\biggr)}, 
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{w}$ is the (constant) density of water, $m_{i}$ is the mass 
variation of the ice sheets, $A_{o}$ is the (constant) area of the present--day oceans 
and the overbar indicates the average over the surface of the oceans 
\begin{equation}\label{average}
\overline {(\ldots)} = \frac{1}{A_{o}} \int_{o} (\ldots) ~dA,
\end{equation}
where $dA=a^{2}\sin\theta d\theta d\lambda$ is the area element 
and $a$ is Earth average radius. From Eq.~(\ref{sle-c}), the SLE can be therefore written as 
\begin{equation}\label{slegia}
S(\omega,t) = \biggl( \frac{\Phi}{\gamma} - U\biggr)  +S^E   - \overline{ \biggl( \frac{\Phi}{\gamma} - U\biggr)}, 
\end{equation}
where the \emph{``eustatic'' \sealevel variation}: 
\begin{equation}\label{eustatic}
S^{E}(t) = - \frac{m_i}{\rho_w A_o},  
\end{equation}
shows the remarkable property 
\begin{equation}
S^{E}(t) = \overline{S}. 
\end{equation}
\noindent The SLE has solution $S=S^{E}$ only in the case of a rigid, 
non self--gravitating Earth ($U = \Phi = 0$ in Eq.~\ref{slegia}).

Functions $U(\omega,t)$ and $\Phi(\omega,t)$ will depend on the spatiotemporal variations of the 
\emph{surface load}:  
\begin{equation}\label{load}
{\cal L}(\omega,t) = \rho_{i}I + \rho_{w} S {\cal O},
\end{equation}
where the two terms on the right hand side are associated with the waxing and waning of the ice sheets 
(\textit{ice load}), and with the redistribution of meltwater in the ocean basins (\textit{ocean load}), 
respectively. 
In Eq.~(\ref{load}), $\rho_i$ is ice density, ${\cal O}$ is the \emph{ocean function}   
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ocean-function}
{\cal O}(\omega) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 
1, & \textrm{if~} \omega \in \textsf{oceans}\\ 
0, & \textrm{if~} \omega \in \textsf{land,} 
\end{array} \right. 
\end{equation} 
(hereinafter referred to as OF), and   
\begin{equation}\label{ice-thick-variation}
I(\omega,t)= T - T_0, 
\end{equation}
is the \emph{ice thickness variation}, where $T(\omega,t)$ is \emph{ice thickness}, and $T_{0}(\omega)$ is a reference 
thickness at a remote time ({e.g.} the thickness at the Last Glacial Maximum, LGM, $21$ kyrs ago). The mass variation in 
Eq.~(\ref{eustatic}) is obtained from (\ref{ice-thick-variation}) by integration over the 
ice--covered regions: 
\begin{equation}\label{mass-variation}
m_{i} (t)= \int_{i} \rho_{i}I ~dA.  
\end{equation}
Following Eq.~(\ref{load}), vertical displacement stems from two terms
\begin{equation}\label{u_sle}
{U}(\omega, t) = \rho_i G_{u}\otimes_i I + \rho_w G_{u}\otimes_o S,  
\end{equation}
where $G_{u}$ is the {Green's} function for vertical displacement, 
$\otimes_i$ and $\otimes_o$ are spatiotemporal convolutions 
over the ice-- and ocean--covered regions, respectively (these convolutions and the Green's functions 
are formally defined in \citeauthor{Spada_and_Stocchi_2006}~\citeyear{Spada_and_Stocchi_2006}). Similarly, the total
variation of the gravity potential is
\begin{equation}\label{phi_sle}
\Phi(\omega,t) = \rho_i G_{\phi}\otimes_i I + \rho_w G_{\phi}\otimes_o S,  
\end{equation}
where $G_{\phi}$ is the corresponding {Green's} function. Explicit expressions for $G_u$ and $G_{\phi}$ are given in e.g.~\citet{Spada_and_Stocchi_2006} in terms of the load--deformation coefficients (LDCs) $h(t)$ and $k(t)$, respectively. The \sealevel Green's function is defined as the difference:  
\begin{equation}\label{gf_sl}
\frac{G_{s}}{\gamma}(\omega,t) =    \frac{G_{\phi}}{\gamma} - {G_{u}}. 
\end{equation}

Substitution of Eqs. (\ref{u_sle}) and (\ref{phi_sle}) into (\ref{slegia}) using (\ref{gf_sl}) gives 
\begin{equation}\label{sle}
S(\omega, t) = \frac{\rho_i}{\gamma} G_s^{} {\otimes}_i I + \frac{\rho_w}{\gamma} G_s^{} {\otimes}_o S 
                             + S^E 
-\frac{\rho_i}{\gamma} \overline {G_s^{} {\otimes}_i I}
-\frac{\rho_w}{\gamma} \overline {G_s^{} {\otimes}_o S}, 
\end{equation}
which represents the SLE in the \emph{``gravitationally self--consistent''} form. Since the unknown $S(\omega,t)$ also appears in the spatiotemporal convolutions at the right hand side, the SLE is an integral equation, which in general cannot be solved in closed form. 
The SLE is a linear equation as long as shorelines are not allowed to migrate horizontally, i.e. if ${\cal O}$ (and consequently $A_o$) 
is not dependent on $S$ itself. Sea level variations are sensitive to mantle rheology through $G_{s}$, since this is determined by the viscoelastic LDCs $h$ and $k$ \citep{Spada-2003a, Spada_and_Stocchi_2006}. Solutions of Eq.~(\ref{sle}) in special cases, discussed in detail by \citet{Spada_and_Stocchi_2006}, are also available via \selen. 

It is worth to observe that the SLE (\ref{sle}) does not involve absolute quantities and can, consequently, only provide \textit{variations} of geophysical and geodetic quantities relative to a reference state. 

\subsection{Solving the Sea Level Equation}\label{sec:solve-the-sle}

The form (\ref{sle}) of the SLE is not suitable for a numerical implementation. In fact,
the spherical harmonic (SH) decomposition of terms terms like $ G_s^{}{\otimes}_o S$, which 
imply an integration over the oceans and not over the whole Earth, would demand evaluating 
coupling coefficients between sets of SHs, which may severely limit the maximum degree of the 
harmonic analysis (SH conventions in \selen are summarized in Section~\ref{sec:shs}). 

The \emph{pseudo--spectral approach} introduced {by \citet{Mitrovica_and_Peltier_1991} 
and}  \citet{Mitrovica_etal_1994}, and implemented in \selens, overcomes this difficulty, since 
it allows for a direct spectral analysis \citep{Milne_1998}. {At the core of the 
method is a change of variable in the SLE, where $S(\omega,t)$ is substituted by its projection on the OF:
\begin{equation}
Z(\omega,t) \equiv {\cal O}S,
\end{equation}
where we define $Z$ as the \emph{modified \sealevel change}. Multiplying both sides of 
Eq.~(\ref{sle}) by ${\cal O}$ gives the SLE in the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sle-z}
Z(\omega,t) = H  + Z^E + K(Z), 
\end{equation}
where: 
\begin{eqnarray}
Z^E(t)      & \equiv & {\cal O}S^E \\
H(\omega,t) & \equiv &{\cal O}(A - \overline{A}) \\
K(Z;\omega,t) & \equiv & {\cal O}(B - \overline{B}), 
\end{eqnarray}
and variables 
\begin{eqnarray}
A(\omega,t) &\equiv & \frac{\rho_i}{\gamma}~ G_s {\otimes}_e I \label{eq:adef}\\
B(\omega,t) &\equiv & \frac{\rho_w}{\gamma}  G_s {\otimes}_e Z \label{eq:bdef},
\end{eqnarray}
now involve an integration (denoted by ${\otimes}_e$) over the whole Earth's surface, which can
be tackled using a standard spectral approach. Using this formalism, the SLE (\ref{sle}) reads 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sle-ab}
S(\omega,t) = A - \overline{A} + S^E + B - \overline{B}  
\end{equation}
and from (\ref{u_sle}) vertical displacement is  
\begin{equation}\label{u-ab}
U(\omega,t) = A_u + B_u,
\end{equation}
where $A_u$ and $B_u$ have the same form of $A$ and $B$ in (\ref{eq:adef}) and (\ref{eq:bdef}), but with $G_s$ replaced by $G_u$. 
Similarly, from (\ref{phi_sle}) and (\ref{g_sle}), the geoid height variation is  
\begin{equation}\label{g-ab}
G(\omega,t) = A_g + B_g,
\end{equation}
where $A_g$ and $B_g$ have the same form of $A$ and $B$, with $G_s$ replaced by $G_\phi$.

Since term $K$ in (\ref{eq:sle-z}) depends on $Z$, the SLE is an integral (implicit) equation, in which the unknown $Z$ appears explicitly at the left--hand side but it is convolved in space and time with $G_s$ on the right hand side. This suggests an iterative approach to the SLE, similar to that employed to solve the one--dimensional inhomogeneous integral Fredholm equations of the second kind. However, the complexity of the SLE (and its three dimensionality) hinders an analytical study of the convergence conditions of the iteration scheme. 

Following \citet{Spada_and_Stocchi_2007}, to which the author is referred for 
more details, the iteration scheme implemented in \selen reads 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:iteration-scheme}
\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 
Z^{(0)}_{\ell m,i} = & Z^E_{\ell m,i} \\
Z^{(k)}_{\ell m,i} = & H_{\ell m,i}  + Z^E_{\ell m,i} + K_{\ell m,i}\left(Z^{(k-1)}_{\ell'm',j}\right),  
\end{array} \right. 
\end{equation} 
where $Z^{(k)}_{\ell m,i}$ is the $k$--th approximation to the degree $\ell$ ($0 \le \ell \le \ell_{max}$) and order $m$ ($0 \le m \le \ell$) component 
of $Z(\omega,t)$, evaluated at the $i$--th time step (a piecewise constant behavior is assumed for all the 
variables involved in the SLE, with a typical time step of $1$ kilo--year). The iteration continues until the ratio 
$|Z^{(k)}_{\ell m,i}-Z^{(k-1)}_{\ell m,i}|$/$|Z^{(k-1)}_{\ell m,i}|$  becomes sufficiently small (according to the numerical tests carried out by \cite{Spada_and_Stocchi_2007}, three to five iterations normally suffice for convergence). Once the SLE is solved, all the other geophysical and geodetic quantities (see e.g. \citeauthor{Spada_etal_2012a}~\citeyear{Spada_etal_2012a}) 
are immediately obtained from the spectral components of Eqs.~(\ref{eq:sle-ab}), (\ref{u-ab}), and (\ref{g-ab}). 

For the numerical evaluation of surface integrals embedded in terms $H$ and $K$ of the SLE 
(Eq.~\ref{eq:sle-z}), \selen takes advantage of the equal--area, icosahedron--shaped, spherical 
pixelization by \citet{Tegmark_1996}, which is particularly convenient for the manipulation 
of harmonic functions.  
The number of pixels on the grid is determined by 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:np}
N_p = 40R(R+1) + 12, 
\end{equation} 
where the integer $R$ is the \textit{grid resolution parameter} \citep{Tegmark_1996}. The pixels 
are the centers of slightly distorted hexagonal grid cells. Assuming that $N_p$ is sufficiently large, 
the area of the surface of the cells is $A_{cell}\sim 4\pi a^2/N_p$
and their radius is $r_{cell} \sim a\sqrt{4/N_p}$, where $a$ is Earth's radius. 
As discussed by \citet{Tegmark_1996}, an accurate numerical integration of harmonic functions up 
to degree $\ell_{max}$ demands a sufficiently large number of grid pixels, with  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:constraint-lmax-r}
N_p \ge \frac{\ell^2_{max}}{3}, 
\end{equation}
where $\ell_{max}$ is the maximum harmonic degree of the SH expansion of the SLE.

\section{How \selen works}\label{sec:how}

\subsection{Software and hardware requirements}\label{sec:sw-hw}

\paragraph{Software.} Running \selen requires a standard UNIX environment (including Linux and Mac OS X) and a Fortran 90 compiler. On Windows systems, \selen can run within the Cygwin environment\footnote{Cygwin is freely downloadable from: http://www.cygwin.com}. \selen also requires the free GMT\footnote{The Generic Mapping Tools can be downloaded from: http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/} (Generic Mapping Tools) mapping software \citep{Wessel_and_Smith_1998}.  

The configuration and build process of \selen 2.9 is handled by standard GNU autoconf scripts\footnote{http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/}.  \selen 2.9 has been succesfully tested using both the freely available g95\footnote{Available from: http://www.g95.org} and gfortran\footnote{Available from: http://gcc.gnu.org/gfortran} compilers, or the commercial Intel Fortran compiler\footnote{More information at: http://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers}. Additional operating system and compiler configurations can be implemented by modifying the \texttt{flags.guess} file and providing suitable options to the \texttt{configure} script. 
%A list of currently supported operating systems and Fortran compilers is given in %\marginpar{T\ref{table:compiler-options}} Table~\ref{table:compiler-options}. 
%To run \selens, the GMT\footnote{The Generic Mapping Tools can be downloaded from: http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/} (Generic Mapping Tools) public domain software of \citet{Wessel_and_Smith_1998} must be installed on the system.

In \selen 2.9, the most computationally intensive portions of code have been parallelized with~\cite{Openmp_2005} directives. The corresponding program units can therefore take advantage of multi--threading on modern CPUs, resulting in a substantial performance improvement\footnote{The g95 compiler does not support OpenMP, so it is not possible to run \selen in parallel with this compiler.}. 

Porting \selen on ``unsupported'' systems should be an easy task.  The only tricky aspect is that program unit \texttt{tb.F90} (the LDCs calculator)  needs quad--precision floating--point (i.e. \texttt{REAL*16}), which is not supported on all platforms.  The Intel fortran compiler and the g95 compiler fully support \texttt{REAL*16} objects. On x86 systems, the GNU gfortran compiler does {not} support \texttt{REAL*16}; however it supports \texttt{REAL*10}, essentially a double-precision fraction with a quad--precision exponent, which is adequate for floating-point computations in \texttt{tb.F90}.  When porting \selen to other platforms, the support and range of \texttt{REAL*16} variables have to be carefully checked.

%A special attention should be paid to the \texttt{PATH} ~system ~variable ~when ~running \selen ~under the Cygwin environment. Since on Windows systems all executables have the \texttt{.exe} suffix, the \texttt{sh} shell binary has the same name of the executable for the \texttt{sh.f90} \selen program unit. To avoid confusion, if the current working directory (``\texttt{.}'') is included in the search path, it must be placed \textit{after} \texttt{/usr/bin}; for instance, with the command \texttt{PATH=\$PATH:.}.  In this way, it is guaranteed that the command (`\texttt{sh}') will invoke the \texttt{sh} shell and not the executable of the \texttt{sh.f90} \selen program unit. 

\paragraph{Hardware.} The hardware requirements of \selen are related to the desired grid resolution parameter $R$ and to the maximum harmonic degree $\ell_{max}$. For low or medium resolutions (approximately $R \le 50$ and $\ell_{max} \le 128$), \selen can run without trouble on a notebook.  High-resolution runs might require a multi-processor system and/or large amounts of RAM.   
The \texttt{TEST} \selen run, described in Section~\ref{section:test-run}, runs in about $34.5$ minutes on an Apple MacBook with a 2GHz dual-core Intel Core 2 Duo CPU and in about $10.5$ minutes on an Apple Mac Pro with two 2.8Ghz quad-core Intel Xeon CPUs.

The execution time of \selen scales with the number of grid pixels $N_p$ and the maximum harmonic degree $\ell_{max}$ as $t_{exe} \sim N_p N_h$ where
$N_h = {(\ell_{max}+1) (\ell_{max}+2)}/{2}$ is the number of SHs for $\ell\le \ell_{max}$. In view of Eq.~(\ref{eq:np}), as a rough approximation
\begin{equation}
t_{exe} \sim \left(R \ell_{max}\right)^2, 
\end{equation} 
where $R$ is the grid resolution parameter. The memory footprint of \selen follows a similar scaling law. For high resolution runs (large values of $\ell_{max}$ and consequently of $R$, see Eq.~\ref{eq:constraint-lmax-r}), disk I/O can become a considerable fraction of $t_{exe}$, and these relations may no longer be valid. 

On multi--core systems, \selen can use multi--threading to reduce computation time (multi--threading was not implemented in previous version of \selens). Multi--threading will automatically be enabled if it is supported by the system and, as a default, all the available cores are used. If the user wishes to leave some resources free for other tasks, the \texttt{OMP\_NUM\_THREADS} environment variable has to be set to the number of usable cores before launching \selen.

Fig.~\ref{fig:scaling} 
%\marginpar{F\ref{fig:scaling}} 
shows the execution time $t_{exe}$ of the \texttt{TEST} as a function of the number of threads $n$ for three test systems.  If the inter-process communication overhead is negligible, the relationship between $t_{exe}$ and $n$ is well approximated by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:amdahl1}
t_{exe}(n) = t_0 \left( f_s + \frac{f_p}{n} \right), 
\end{equation}
where $f_s$ and $f_p$ are the serial and parallel fractions of the code ($f_s+f_p=1$), and $t_0$ is the serial execution time \citep{Amdahl_1967}.  Eq.~(\ref{eq:amdahl1}) can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:amdahl2}
n t_{exe}(n) = t_0 \left( f_p + f_s n \right), 
\end{equation}
showing that when the speedup of the parallel portion of the code is linear, the relation between $nt_{exe}$ and $n$ is also linear. Measured values of $nt_{exe}$ for the \texttt{TEST} run are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:scaling}. By fitting Eq.~(\ref{eq:amdahl2}) to the points in Fig.~\ref{fig:scaling} it is possible to evaluate the parallel fraction $f_p$ of the code, which for the \texttt{TEST} run is within $0.7$ and $0.8$. This value depends on the specific options selected in the \texttt{config.dat}; for instance, enabling the execution of the GMT scripts (which are sequential tasks) results in a lower parallelism level.

\subsection{Configuration and execution files}
The configuration and the execution of the program involve several files and scripts 
in the \selen directory. For a normal execution of \selens,
the user only needs to edit and modify the configuration file {\texttt{config.dat}}. 

\vspace{0.3cm}
\noindent The relevant scripts and programs for configuration and execution are: 

\begin{description}
\item [\texttt{config.dat}] is the configuration file of \selens. It is a plain text file that can 
be easily configured by the user according to the specific tasks to be accomplished. The structure of the file and the configuration rules are described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:configuration} below. A sample {\texttt{config.dat}}, configured for a \texttt{TEST} run, is provided in Section~\ref{sec:sample-config}, 
%\item [\texttt{makeselen.sh}] is the execution shell script of \selens. It performs the 
%following tasks: \textit{i)} parsing of {\texttt{config.dat}} to identify the Fortran compilation 
%options \textit{ii)} compilation of SHTOOLS programs, \textit{iii)} compilation and execution of the setup program \texttt{config.f90} and \textit{iv)}
%execution of the shell script \texttt{selen.sh}. Script \texttt{makeselen.sh} also handles some 
%error conditions,
\item [{\texttt{config.f90}}] is the \selen setup program. This program \textit{i)} 
parses {\texttt{config.dat}}, \textit{ii)} creates the shell script  \texttt{selen.sh} which physically executes the \selen run, 
\textit{iii)} creates  the ``include file'' \texttt{data.inc}, which contains declarations useful to all the Fortran units needed
for the execution (the full list is given in 
\marginpar{T\ref{table:fortran-units}} 
Table~\ref{table:fortran-units}), \textit{iv)} creates the GMT scripts needed for visualization of the results. The implementation of new features in \selen will demand, in general, adding new subprograms to {\texttt{config.f90}} or modifying the existing ones.   The setup program also performs several checks on the input parameters, and exits with an error message if inconsistencies are found. 
\item [\texttt{selen.sh}] is a shell script, created by {\texttt{config.f90}}, containing execution commands for the Fortran units of \selen which are required to fulfill the user's tasks. 
This script also creates the \texttt{depot} directory structure where
the \selen outputs are stored, and purges the working directory from temporary files before and after the execution of the program.
\end{description}

\subsection{Input and output data}\label{sec:input-output}
\paragraph{Input.} The \selen input data are organized in several sub--directories:  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Folder {\texttt{DATA}} collects various files with information about geophysical and geodetic sites of interest and other miscellanea data, 
\item Folder {\texttt{ICE-MODELS}} contains the files describing the time chronology of each the ice models available by \selens,
\item Folder {\texttt{VSC}} stores a collection of viscosity profiles. 
\item Folder {\texttt{INPUTS}} stores user--generated input files, such as pixel table files, pre--computed SH coefficients at the grid pixels and SH coefficients of the ice thickness data. 
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Output.} 
The \selen outputs consist of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item ASCII files with various formats, 
\item PostScript and PDF graphic files, 
\item GMT scripts.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent After each run, \selen outputs are stored in a subfolder \texttt{depot-}\textit{name}, where \textit{name} is a 4--character label defined by the user in the \texttt{config.dat} file (see Section~\ref{sec:configuration}). The \texttt{depot} output subfolders are created into the \texttt{DEPOTS} folder of the \selen directory, and their structure is described in 
%\marginpar{T\ref{table:folders}} 
Table~\ref{table:folders}. 

Some of the \selen intermediate outputs, such as SH coefficients at the grid pixels, SH coefficients of the ice thickness data or pixel table files, can be reused as input files for subsequent \selen runs.  After a \selen run, these files are stored in the \texttt{run} folder of the \selen working directory; in order to make them available for later reuse, they have to be manually moved into the \texttt{INPUTS} folder.

\section{Setting up and running \selen}

\subsection{Installation}\label{sec:installation}
The installation of \selen is straightforward. The user just needs ~to ~un--zip ~the ~\selen ~package 
in any chosen folder.  If not already available on the system, a supported Fortran compiler and the GMT mapping software \citep{Wessel_and_Smith_1998} must be also installed.

\subsection{Configuration}\label{sec:configuration}
The configuration file of \selen is the plain text file \texttt{config.dat}. Here we describe its structure and illustrate the options available to the user. A sample configuration file, employed for a \texttt{TEST} run in Section~\ref{section:test-run}}, is listed 
in Section~\ref{sec:sample-config}. 

\vspace{0.6cm}
\noindent File \texttt{config.dat} is composed of two sections:

\begin{itemize}
\item  \texttt{SECTION 1}
contains the general settings of \selens. It defines the approximation (mode of solution) employed to solve the SLE, the rheological profile of the Earth model and the spatiotemporal features of the surface load (ice model). 

\texttt{SECTION 1} is marked by the header:

{\color{Cyan}{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
    ...
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    This is SECTION (1) of "config.dat": SELEN settings
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    ...
\end{verbatim} }}

The options for \texttt{SECTION 1} are described in Section~\ref{section:general-options}.

\item \texttt{SECTION 2} can be configured to schedule the outputs of 
\selens. These are ASCII files and tables, plots and diagrams. The particular set
of outputs will of course depend on the kind of analysis planned by the user. 
After execution, the outputs are collected in a \texttt{depot} folder
(see Table~\ref{table:folders}). 

\texttt{SECTION 2} is marked by the header:

{\color{Magenta}{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
    ...
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    This is SECTION (2) of "config.dat: SELEN outputs
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    ...
\end{verbatim} }}

The options for \texttt{SECTION 2} are described in Section~\ref{section:output-settings}.

\end{itemize}

\noindent In both sections, the options are organized in text blocks like this:

{\color{black}{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
    ...
    ====> TITLE for this block of options 
    lab-1   Option-1       Description      switches and more data                  
    lab-2   Option-2       Description               ...                                             
     ..      ...               ...                   ...
     ..      ...               ...                   ...
    lab-n   Option-n           ...                   ... 
    ...
\end{verbatim} }}
\noindent where the three--character string \texttt{lab-k} labels \texttt{Option-k}, 
which comes with a short \texttt{Description}. The field 
\texttt{switches and more data} has the form 
\begin{verbatim}
'y' 'filename' 
\end{verbatim}
\noindent or 
\begin{verbatim}
'n' 'parameter1' 'parameter2'  
\end{verbatim}
\noindent where \texttt{'y'} and \texttt{'n'} stand for \textit{yes} and \textit{no}, respectively.  

The only formatting requirements of file \texttt{config.dat} are: \textit{i)} 
labels \texttt{lab-k} must be placed in the first three columns of the file; \textit{ii)} 
\textit{ALL} the options, switches and data \textit{must} be enclosed in primes and can 
be freely placed on the corresponding line. Lines in \texttt{config.dat} which do not begin 
with a valid label (i.e., a label recognized by the setup program \texttt{config.f90}) are ignored, 
and therefore can be used for user comments. 

\subsubsection{Program settings}\label{section:general-options}       

The options of \texttt{SECTION 1} of \texttt{config.dat} are organized in eight text blocks:
\textit{
\begin{description}
\item[1.] Environment settings,
\item[2.] Mode of solution, 
\item[3.] Spatial resolution and reference frame,  
\item[4.] Choice of the rheological model, 
\item[5.] Choice of the ice model, 
\item[6.] Computation of SHs at grid pixels,
\item[7.] Ocean Function, 
\item[8.] Output data archive, 
\end{description}}
\noindent which are sequentially described below in separate paragraphs. 

\vspace{0.4cm}\noindent{\textbf{1. Environment settings}}

{\color{Cyan}{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
    ...
    ====> PURGING option ----------------------------------------------------------
    110  Purging the wdir before & after execution                      'y'
         [see config.f90 for purged filenames extensions ]
    ...
\end{verbatim} }}
\noindent In this first section of \texttt{config.dat}, option \texttt{110} can be used to remove auxiliary files from the working directory before \selen is executed (this is particularly useful in the case the previous run of \selen has crashed, possibly leaving some junk files around). 

\vspace{0.4cm}\noindent{\textbf{2. Mode of solution}}

{\color{Cyan}{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
    ...
    ====> SOLUTION of the SLE -----------------------------------------------------
    130    Iterations & mode of solution                              '5'    '1' 	    			 	
    Modes:  1= Gravitationally self-consistent (GSC)
            2= Elastic GSC / 3="Eustatic" / 4="Woodward" / 5="No Ice" 
\end{verbatim} }}
\noindent Here, we solve the SLE in ``mode 1", i.e. in its full ``Gravitationally self-consistent'' form expressed by Eq.~(\ref{sle}), and we configure \selen for five iterations (generally three 
ensure convergence of the iterative scheme, see \citeauthor{Spada_and_Stocchi_2007}~\citeyear{Spada_and_Stocchi_2007}). 

Other modes of solution available through option \texttt{130} above are discussed by \citet{Spada_and_Stocchi_2007}; experimenting different solution modes can indeed be 
very useful to understand the physics behind the SLE and how the program works. 

\vspace{0.4cm}\noindent{\textbf{3. Spatial resolution and reference frame}}

{\color{Cyan}{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
    ...
    ====> MAXIMUM HARMONIC DEGREE -------------------------------------------------
    140    LMAX     				                       '128'  
    
    ====> REFERENCE FRAME ---------------------------------------------------------
    145    Includes degree 1 Love numbers (CM/CE frames)             'y'  'CM'   
    
    ====> TEGMARK RESOLUTION ------------------------------------------------------
    150    R                  				             '33'                         
    151    Prepare a new pixel table (y/n, filename)         'y' 'px-table-r44.dat'    ...
\end{verbatim} }}
\noindent In this example, the SLE is solved to maximum degree $\ell_{max}=128$ (option \texttt{140}). 

LDCs of harmonic degree $\ell=0$ are not computed since they vanish identically because of incompressibility (the volume of the Earth is constant). However, they would not play any role even for a compressible Earth since the SLE includes explicitly the constraint of mass conservation, expressed by Eq.~(\ref{c-constant}). 

If the computation of LDCs of harmonic degree $\ell=1$ is requested (\texttt{145}) (LDCs of harmonic degree one are discussed in 
e.g. \citeauthor{Spada_etal_2011}~\citeyear{Spada_etal_2011}), the program outputs can be 
expressed in two
possible reference frames. The first (\texttt{CM}) is the reference frame with origin in the center of mass of the
whole Earth (including the solid and fluid portions), while the second is the reference frame with origin in the 
center of the undeformed Earth (\texttt{CE}). It is important to note that the solution of the SLE, i.e. \sealevel change $S(\omega,t)$
(see Eq.~\ref{sle-original}), is the same in the two frames. The same holds for RSL (\ref{eq:rsl-vs-s}). However, surface 
displacements, the sea surface variation and the gravity potential variations are indeed sensitive to this choice. 

The grid resolution parameter \texttt{R} (option \texttt{150}) determines the number of pixels of the Tegmark grid 
by Eq.~(\ref{eq:np}) and the spatial resolution of the oceans/continents distribution (see caption of Fig.~\ref{fig:pixelization} for more details). Note that parameters \texttt{LMAX} and \texttt{R} must obey constraint (\ref{eq:constraint-lmax-r}), which ensures an optimal integration on the sphere. This condition is checked by \texttt{config.f90} and an error message is displayed if it is not satisfied. 

When a new Tegmark grid is generated, \selen identifies oceanic and continental grid pixels by invoking the GMT utility \texttt{gmtselect}, and creates a ``pixel table'' file (in the example above, \texttt{px-table-r44.dat}) where grid pixels are flagged as ``wet'' or ``dry''.  Since this process can be relatively time consuming, especially for large values of grid resolution \texttt{R}, a previously computed pixel table file can be reused in subsequent runs (if \texttt{R} is unchanged) by setting \texttt{'n'} in option \texttt{161}. In this case, the pixel table file has to be placed in the \texttt{INPUTS} folder.

\vspace{0.4cm}\noindent{\textbf{4. Choice of the rheological model}}

{\color{Cyan}{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
    ...
    ====> RHEOLOGICAL MODEL -------------------------------------------------------
    160    Rheological profile info:                         '2' '2' 'vsc_BJ97.dat'  
    ...
\end{verbatim} }}
\noindent The choice of the Earth rheological profile, necessary for the computation of 
the LDCs, is made through option \texttt{160}. In \selens, the computation of the 
LDCs is accomplished by TABOO~\citep{Spada-2003a,tabooeos}, a program 
based on the Viscoelastic Normal Modes theory \citep{Peltier_1974}. 

Option \texttt{160} above allows to provide the number 
of desired mantle layers \texttt{NV} (here \texttt{NV=2}) and a code (here \texttt{CODE=2}).
These parameters identify the values of the density and of the shear modulus of each layer 
as well as the radii of the interfaces between layers. The reader is referred to the TABOO 
User guide for information about the options available for \texttt{NV} and a model 
\texttt{CODE} (see, in particular, Appendix 5.4 of the TABOO program 
user guide\footnote{http://samizdat.mines.edu/taboo/user\_guide.pdf}, \citeauthor{Spada-2003b} 
\citeyear{Spada-2003b}). 
Note that all models available by TABOO (hence by \selens) assume an elastic lithosphere and a 
perfectly homogeneous and inviscid core. 

In the sample configuration above, the Maxwell viscosities of the mantle layers and the lithospheric 
thickness are 
provided by the user--supplied ASCII file \texttt{vsc\_BJ97.dat} (this file must be 
placed in folder \texttt{VSC} before execution).


\vspace{0.4cm}\noindent{\textbf{5. Choice of the ice model}}

{\color{Cyan}{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
    ...
    ====> ICE MODEL ---------------------------------------------------------------
    170    Ice file name                               'ice3g.dat'  
    171    Prepare a new SH ice file (y/n, filename)       'y'  'ice3g-l128.dat'
    172    Ice history time step (kyrs)                       '1.0'  
    ...
\end{verbatim} }}
\noindent The ice file name is set by option \texttt{170} (this 
name identifies model ICE--3G~ of \citeauthor{Tushingham_and_Peltier_1991}~\citeyear{Tushingham_and_Peltier_1991}). 

With option \texttt{171}, we are scheduling the computation of a new set of SH coefficients of the 
ice thickness distribution of ICE--3G to harmonic degree \texttt{LMAX} (consistently
with option \texttt{140}). These will be written on the ASCII 
file \texttt{ice3g-l128.dat} in the \texttt{run} directory. Since the computation 
of the SH coefficients is relatively CPU intensive, the same file can be 
utilized in subsequent runs if the \texttt{LMAX} parameter
is not changed, setting \texttt{'n'} in option \texttt{171} and copying it into the \texttt{INPUTS} folder. 

In folder \texttt{ICE-MODELS}, various ice models are available 
%\marginpar{T\ref{table:ice-models}} 
(see Table~\ref{table:ice-models}). These include some of the 
previous ICE--X models developed by Prof. W. R. Peltier and co--workers (ICE--1 and ICE--5G).  
Folder \texttt{ICE-MODELS} also contains individual regional components of these ice models and 
some other ``test'' ice models. Using specific {Fortran} formats described in the \selen setup 
program \texttt{config.f90}, the user can indeed introduce other \textit{ad hoc} ice models 
according to specific purposes.

\vspace{0.4cm}\noindent{\textbf{6. Computation of SHs at grid pixels}}

{\color{Cyan}{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
    ...
    ====> SPHERICAL HARMONICS (SH) FILE AT PIXELS ---------------------------------
    180    A new SH file  (y/n, filename)                    'y'  'sh-r33-l128.bin'  
    ...
\end{verbatim} }}
\noindent Using option \texttt{180}, the user can specify whether to schedule a new computation of SHs at the grid pixels or 
to employ a pre--computed SH file. Since SH computation is an intensive task, re--using pre--computed SHs can be particularly
convenient. The SH set is sensitive to the \texttt{R} and \texttt{LMAX} values (options \texttt{140} and \texttt{150}). We experimented that using a SH binary file generated on a different system (or even with a different compiler) can lead to unexepected results.

In the case a pre--computed file with name \texttt{sh-r33-l128.bin} ~exists already 
in the \texttt{INPUTS} folder, ~the ~switch ~\texttt{'n'} ~can be set in option \texttt{180}
to avoid a new, time--consuming computation. 

\vspace{0.4cm}\noindent{\textbf{7. Ocean Function}}

{\color{Cyan}{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
    ...
    ====> OCEAN FUNCTION (OF) -----------------------------------------------------
    190    A new OF SH decomposition (y/n, filename)         'y'  'of-l128.dat'
    ...
\end{verbatim} }}
\noindent With option \texttt{190}, the user can supply the name of the file that will 
store the coefficients of the SH decomposition of the OF (the ocean
function ${\cal O}(\omega)$ is defined by Eq.~\ref{eq:ocean-function}). 
The chosen filename contains information about the values the \texttt{LMAX} parameter 
(option \texttt{140}). 

If a pre--computed file of SH OF coefficients with name \texttt{of-l128.dat} exists in 
\texttt{INPUTS}, the switch \texttt{'n'} can be set to avoid a new computation. 

\vspace{0.4cm}\noindent{\textbf{8. Output data archive (depot)}}

{\color{Cyan}{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
    ...
    ====> REPOSITORY LABEL --------------------------------------------------------
    195    The depot name  (four characters)                 'T001' 
\end{verbatim} }}
\noindent The name of the \texttt{depot} where the output data will be stored is given using option \texttt{195}. 
It must be four--characters long (in the example above, the name of the depot folder will be 
\texttt{depot-T001}). The general structure of the \selen \texttt{depot} is described in Table~\ref{table:folders}. By default, all 
the \texttt{depot} subfolders will be created by \selens, regardless of the effective configuration of the corresponding tasks. 

The depot folder will be created in the \texttt{DEPOTS} directory. If a depot named \texttt{depot-T001} already exists in \texttt{DEPOTS}, the user is warned by a message
on the monitor that existing data will be overwritten.

\subsubsection{Output settings}\label{section:output-settings}

The options of \texttt{SECTION 2} of \texttt{config.dat} are organized in eight text blocks:

\noindent During execution, \selen creates various GMT scripts that have the purpose of
plotting maps, diagrams, etc. based on the program outputs (various examples 
are given in Section~\ref{sec:outputs-test-run} for a \texttt{TEST} run).  Since for high--resolution 
computations the execution of the GMT scripts can be quite time consuming, the user can control
their execution by option \texttt{200} above. 

When \texttt{'n'} is set, \selen will produce the GMT scripts but these will not be executed. 
In this case, the outputs of \selen can be easily transformed in plots at a later stage (the GMT 
scripts, generated by the setup program \texttt{config.f90}, are in fact  copied into the same 
\texttt{depot} folder where the \selen output data are stored). Alternatively, they can be visualized with other 
graphical tools preferred by the user. In particular, for high--resolution runs, some of the default 
GMT scripts created by SELEN may be not efficient.

\end{verbatim} }}
\noindent This text box can be configured to visualize the geometrical properties of the grid corresponding to the grid resolution parameter \texttt{R} (\texttt{SECTION 1}, option \texttt{150}). Plotting the grid (option \texttt{205}) can be useful to familiarize with the numerical solution of the SLE or for teaching purposes. 

By the switch with label \texttt{206} the user can perform a numerical test of the SH orthogonality on the Tegmark grid, based on the evaluation of a ``window function'' \citep{Tegmark_1996}. When condition (\ref{eq:constraint-lmax-r}) is met, the SH orthogonality is verified to a very high--precision (otherwise
\selen will stop). 

Data concerning the pixelization and the window function are stored, after execution,
in folders \texttt{depot-T001/px} and \texttt{depot-T001/wnw}, respectively. The grid 
employed in the \texttt{TEST} run described in Section~\ref{section:test-run}
is visualized in 
%\marginpar{F\ref{fig:pixelization}} 
Fig.~\ref{fig:pixelization}. The caption provides more details 
on how the pixelization is performed by \selens.

\noindent In \selens, the ocean function (OF, defined by Eq.~\ref{eq:ocean-function}) plays an important role, since it defines the domain upon which the ocean load is acting (see Eq.~\ref{load}).
Option \texttt{210} can be used for plotting the OF and its SH reconstruction (at degree \texttt{LMAX}),
based on the coefficients computed by option \texttt{190} above. 
The comparison between the original and the reconstructed OF can be useful for appreciating the effects of the truncation of the SH series at the chosen level of spatial resolution (an example is given in 
%\marginpar{F\ref{fig:ocean-function}}
Figure~\ref{fig:ocean-function}). 
A plot of the degree variance of the OF can be obtained by switch \texttt{215}. 

All data (ASCII tables and plots, if required) concerning the OF are available in folders \texttt{depot-T001/of} after the execution of \selens.

\noindent With these three switches, the users can control some outputs concerning the ice 
sheet model chosen (see \texttt{SECTION 1}, label \texttt{170}). These include plots of 
the spatial distribution of the ice thickness (option \texttt{220}), and the 
equivalent \sealevel (ESL) function (\texttt{221}). The reconstruction of the ice sheets 
thickness distribution from the SH coefficients is controlled by option \texttt{222}. 

After execution, all the ice model data (ASCII tables and plots, if required) 
are stored in the \texttt{depot-T001/ICE3G} (the folder name \texttt{ICE3G} is set by \selen 
according to the ice model name in option \texttt{170}).

With term ``spectral properties'' we denote the isostatic relaxation spectrum, and the 
elastic, fluid, and viscous components of the LDCs. These quantities and their physical meaning 
are discussed in detail in e.g. \citet{Spada_etal_2011}.

\noindent When option \texttt{240} is set to \texttt{y}, the lines above allow for a Relative Sea Level (RSL) analysis at specific sites of a user--supplied database with a format recognizable by the setup program \texttt{config.f90} and by programs \texttt{rsl.f90} and \texttt{sh\_rsl.f90}. A sample is given in file \texttt{DATA/sealevel.dat} (the format label is \texttt{0}, in this case), which contains information about sites for which 
radiocarbon--controlled RSL data are available, according to the compilation of \citet{Tushingham_and_Peltier_1992,Tushingham_and_Peltier_1993}. Options \texttt{240-245} are self--explicatory (examples of the corresponding outputs will be given in Section~\ref{section:test-run} for a \texttt{TEST} run). 

By option \texttt{250}, global visualizations of the so--called ``Clark zones'' \citep{Clark_etal_1978} 
or ``RSL zones''can be obtained. These are regions of the globe where the RSL curves show similar features. A regional RSL study can be obtained by switch \texttt{251}, where RSL contour lines are plotted at a given time. Data
about the time of the analysis, the region of interest, and the plot style are supplied in file
\texttt{DATA/rsl-region.dat}.

If the switch \texttt{260} is set, the user can obtain a plot of the TGs
distribution (option \texttt{261}), a scatterplot of the TG data (\texttt{262}) and a
summary table where rates of change of $S$, $N$ and $U$ at present time are 
given for each TG (option \texttt{263}).

\noindent This section of the configuration file is dedicated to predictions of
present--day variations of various geodetic quantities. 

Option \texttt{270} gives
access to global maps of \textit{fingeprints} showing the rates of change of $S$, $U$ and
$N$, for the Earth model and ice sheets distribution chosen by options \texttt{160} and 
\texttt{170}, respectively (the maps showing the fingerprints are available
in folder \texttt{depot-T001/gmaps}). Regional plots are available by switch 
\texttt{280} and the regional options \texttt{281-287}, with results provided in 
folder \texttt{depot-T001/rmaps}. 

For sites listed in the user--supplied \texttt{DATA/NA\_KK.txt}, switch \texttt{275} 
gives access to the Up, North, and East components of the present--day velocity 
field (this is particularly useful for the interpretation of GPS signals) and to 
$\dot S$, $\dot U$ and $\dot N$ as well (the dot indicates the time derivative).  All 
these predictions are collected in folder \texttt{depot-TEST/geod/sites}. 

By option \texttt{290}, the user can obtain predictions for the GIA component 
of the present--day rates
of change of the Stokes coefficients of the Earth's gravity field in a specific range of
harmonic degrees (here, the range is $2\le \ell \le 20$). The coefficients, which are 
normalized according to the GRACE conventions for spherical harmonics and expressed
in units of $10^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$, are 
available in folder \texttt{depot-T001/stokes}\footnote{See rev. 2.3 of the Level--2 
Gravity Field Product User Handbook at page 5, available from 
ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/allData/grace/docs/L2-UserHandbook\_v2.3.pdf).}. 


\subsection{Execution}\label{sec:execution}

\noindent Before launching \selen, the configuration script has to be invoked with the command:

{\color{red}{\normalsize\begin{verbatim} 
$ configure
\end{verbatim} }}
\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent The \texttt{configure} script will automatically identify the available Fortran compiler on the system and configure \selen accordingly.  If several Fortran compilers are installed, the user can explictly select a compiler with the command 
{\color{red}{\normalsize\begin{verbatim} 
$ configure FC=name
\end{verbatim} }}
\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent where \texttt{name} is the Fortran compiler command (for instance, \texttt{gfortran} or \texttt{ifort}).  The \texttt{configure} script will also check the availability of the GMT utilities. If no error is found, \selen can be  launched with
{\color{red}{\normalsize\begin{verbatim} 
$ make run
\end{verbatim} }}
\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent This command will compile the \selen program units, set up the working folder \texttt{run} in the \selen directory and launch \selen.  A typical \selen run consists of three main execution steps. At the end of execution, the \selen outputs are 
available in the \texttt{depot} folder (see Table~\ref{table:folders}). 
\begin{description}
\item[Step 1: Pre--computation of gridded SHs and of LDCs.] At step $1$, \selen builds the spatial 
grid (see Section~\ref{sec:solve-the-sle} and Fig.~\ref{fig:pixelization}), obtains a discrete 
realization of the OF, performs the SH expansions of the ice thickness variation $I$ and of the OF, 
and computes the LDCs. The SHs at degree $\ell_{max}$ are computed at all grid pixels, 
\item[Step 2: Numerical solution of the SLE.] At step $2$, \selen solves numerically the SLE 
by the pseudo--spectral method, ~employing ~the ~iterative ~scheme ~described by Eqs.~(\ref{eq:iteration-scheme}), 
and computes the SH coefficients of surface displacements and gravity potential variations, 
\item[Step 3: Computation of geophysical and geodetic quantities.] In ~the ~last ~step, ~\selen ~uses ~the solution of the SLE in the spectral domain to obtain predictions of geophysical and geodetic quantities by SH synthesis, according to the settings in the configuration file \texttt{config.dat}
(see Section \ref{sec:configuration}). 
\end{description}

The execution of \selen should produce various messages on the monitor, reporting
the most important stages of the run. A sample is given in Section~\ref{sec:flow} below. 
\selen can be reset by entering
{\color{red}{\normalsize\begin{verbatim} 
$ make clean
\end{verbatim} }}
\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent which clears the \selen configuration and deletes the \selen working directory \texttt{run}.  This command can be useful if the user wants to restart from scratch, for instance to recover from a previous \selen crash.  
\clearpage 

\section{A \texttt{TEST} run}\label{section:test-run}

To provide an example of the use of \selen 2.9, we have configured the program for a \texttt{TEST} run.

We advise the user to run this test on his/her own PC and to compare the results 
with those obtained on our machine (an Apple MacBook configured with a 2GHz Intel Core 2 Duo and running Mac OS X 10.5.8).

\subsection{Configuration file for the \texttt{TEST} run}\label{sec:sample-config}
For the sake of the reader's convenience, file \texttt{config.dat} for the \texttt{TEST}
run described in Section~\ref{section:test-run} is copied below. This file is 
available from the \selen distribution package. 

{\color{black}{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  This is file "config.dat" for SELEN 2.9 - 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The user can configure SELEN by the switches below. Any option is to be written within primes 
(e. g., 'option'). A three-digits, left aligned numerical code is provided for each entry (e. 
g., 001). 

In section 1 (settings) the user supplies the spatial resolution, the ice sheets distribution, 
and the Earth model viscoelastic structure. This allows one to solve the Sea Level Equation but 
no graphical output is obtained. 

In section 2 (outputs), a number of optional outputs can be scheduled, including tables and plots 
of numerical results. The required GMT scripts are automatically generated according to the 
options chosen. 

For help, comments, or suggestion, you can contact the authors at the addresses below or consult 
the SELEN web page at http://geodynamics.org/cig/software/selen

\subsection{Conventions for Spherical Harmonics}\label{sec:shs}
In the SLE theory and in program \selens, we 
adopt \textit{complex, $4\pi$--normalized spherical harmonic (SH) functions}: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ylm}
{\cal Y}_{\ell m}(\omega) = 
\sqrt{(2\ell +1)\frac{(\ell -m)!}{(\ell +m)!}}
P_{\ell m} (\cos\theta) \textrm{e}^{im\lambda}, 
\end{equation}
where $\omega\equiv (\theta,\lambda)$, $\theta$ is colatitude ($0\le \theta\le \pi$), $\lambda$ is longitude ($0\le \lambda\le 2\pi$), $\ell$ is the harmonic degree ($\ell =0, 1, \ldots$), $m$ is the order 
($m=0, 1, \ldots, \ell$) and $P_{\ell m}(\cos\theta)$ are the associated Legendre polynomials
\begin{equation}\label{eq:plm}
P_{\ell m} (x) =  (-1)^m (1-x^2)^{\frac{m}{2}} \frac{d^m}{dx^m} P_\ell (x), 
\end{equation}
where factor $(-1)^{m}$ is known as the 
Condon--Shortley phase, and 
\begin{equation}
P_\ell(x) = \frac{1}{2^\ell \ell !} \frac{d^\ell}{dx^\ell}(x^2-1)^\ell
\end{equation} 
are the Legendre polynomials. 

SHs with negative order are defined by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ylm-negative-order}
{\cal Y}_{\ell, -m}(\omega) = {\cal Y}^\ast_{\ell m}(\omega),
\end{equation}
where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate. By definition (\ref{eq:ylm}), the orthogonality 
condition of the SHs reads 
\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^\pi {\cal Y}_{\ell m}(\omega) {\cal Y}^*_{\ell' m'}(\omega) d\omega =
4\pi \delta_{\ell \ell'}\delta_{mm'}, 
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
d\omega \equiv \sin \theta d\theta d\lambda
\end{equation}
and $\delta_{ij}$ is Kronecker delta. In \selens, the SHs are computed numerically 
using routines from the {SHTOOLS} package\footnote{http://www.ipgp.fr/wieczor/SHTOOLS/SHTOOLS.html}.

\subsection{Availability of SELEN}
Program \selen (version 2.9) is hosted by the CIG at the page: \texttt{http://geodynamics.org/cig/software/selen}. \\

\noindent \selen is also available from the web page \textit{http://hpc.rm.ingv.it/selen}, or from the authors. 

\subsection{Related software}
%\marginpar{FINIRE}
\begin{description}
\item[TABOO.] Program TABOO is a post--glacial rebound calculator written in Fortran 90. It is \textit{not} a SLE solver. \selen includes the basic components of TABOO in order to compute the LDCs (see program \texttt{tb.F90}). TABOO, along with its documentation, is available from the Samizdat press\footnote{http://samizdat.mines.edu/taboo/}, 
\item[\textit{s}TABOO.] This is a light version of TABOO, written for absolute beginners. It has been 
written for the students of the PhD course/workshop on Sea Level Rise and Ice Sheets,
held at Center for Ice and Climate, University of Copenhagen (21-25 May, 2012). It
comes with installation instructions and can be obtained by email from GS, 
\item[ALMA.] Program ALMA\footnote{http://www.fis.uniurb.it/spada/ALMA\_minipage.html} \citep{Spada_2008} computes the LDCs for multi--layered Earth models with a generalized Maxwell rheology, adopting a special method of inversion for Laplace transforms~\citep{Spada_and_Boschi_2006}. 
\end{description}

\subsection{Previous reference documents}
Previous versions of \selen and of the theory behind have been described in various papers and documents. 
In these works, the readers can find more details and hints, as well as various references to previous
relevant papers on the subject: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The theory behind the SLE is described in a booklet\footnote{http://samizdat.mines.edu/sle/sle.pdf}
published from the Samizdat Press\footnote{http://www.samizdat.edu} in 2005. This material has been subsequently 
revised and reorganized, and published by \citet{Spada_and_Stocchi_2006}, 
\item the work by \citet{Spada_and_Stocchi_2007} contains a condensed theory of the SLE and illustrates the 
first version of \selens, which in this document is referred to as \selen 1.0, 
\item The current version of \selen (2.9) is presented in the manuscript by \citet{Spada_etal_2012b} (arXiv:1212.5061),
where also some applications are discussed. The present manual is essentially a user--oriented version of this paper.  
\item The Sea Level Equation page on Wikipedia\footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea\_level\_equation}
gives a short definition of the SLE.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SELEN benchmarks}

During the last few years, in the framework of the European COST Action ES0701 ``Improved Constraints on Models of 
Glacial Isostatic Adjustment''\footnote{http://www.cost-es0701.geoenvi.org/}, various benchmark tests on GIA modeling have been performed. 

Until present, the results concerning Post Glacial Rebound modeling have been published in the paper by \cite{Spada_etal_2011}. In
this work, program TABOO (based on the Viscoelastic Normal Modes method of \citeauthor{Peltier_1974}~\citeyear{Peltier_1974}) has been successfully tested against various programs used in the community, often based on completely different techniques. Since \selen computes the LDCs using TABOO, and the LDCs enter the 
Green's functions that appear in the SLE, the \cite{Spada_etal_2011} benchmark
has validated these fundamental components of the program.

of the ice load and the (fixed) continent--ocean boundary.}}
\label{fig:benchmark} 
\end{center} 
\end{figure}

The idea of a SLE benchmark dates back to the mid 1990s, and was first launched by the colleagues Georg Kaufmann and Paul Johnston (the whole story and subsequent developments are reviewed in the Introduction of the \citet{Spada_etal_2011} paper, where some useful links are also given). At the current stage (January 2013), a number of tests computations have been performed in the context of the European COST Action ES0701, and a manuscript is in preparation. 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:benchmark} we show the outcomes of some SLE computations independently performed by Valentina Barletta (VB),
Zdenek Martinec (ZM), Tom James and Karen Simons (TJ\& KS), Volker Klemann (VK), {Wouter van der Wal} (WW)
and myself (GS, based on a suitably designed version of \selens). Here, the SLE is solved assuming an ocean--continents distribution with zonal symmetry wrt the axis $\theta=0^\circ$. The continent, which extends to colatitude $\theta=25^\circ$, is loaded by a ice sheet with 
parabolic profile (i.e., a \textit{cap}, see \citeauthor{Spada_etal_2011}~\citeyear{Spada_etal_2011}) having a thickness of $1500$ m at the
centre and half amplitude $\alpha=10^\circ$, and characterized by a Heaviside time--history (the load is switched on at time $t=0$). The ice and water density are $\rho_w=1000$ kg m$^{-3}$ and $\rho_i =920$ kg m$^{-3}$, respectively. 
Shorelines are not allowed to migrate horizontally and the Earth is not rotating. The rheological model is the same employed in the \citet{Spada_etal_2011} exercise (i.e., the five--layer, incompressible viscoelastic model M3--L70--V01, see their Table 3). \selen has been configured for a ``gravitationally self--consistent'' mode of solutions with three
iterations, with a grid resolution parameter \texttt{R=44}, and a maximum harmonic degree \texttt{LMAX=128}. The SLE is
solved in the CM frame. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:benchmark}, which illustrates the history and the spatial pattern of $S(\omega,t)$, indicates that the various numerical solutions of the SLE are, for this axisymmetric test, substantially in agreement. New tests, which are under way, are
dealing with the
more challenging case of a realistic ocean function and a complex ice sheets distribution.
